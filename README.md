# Self-Driving-Car
In this project, a simple and naïve self-driving car is developed. This project is the implementation of Nvidia’s “End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars” paper. It is a supervised regression problem between the car steering angles and the road images in real-time from the cameras of a car.
